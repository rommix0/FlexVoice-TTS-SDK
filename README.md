# Mindmaker's FlexVoice TTS SDK

This is the rare FlexVoice text to speech synthesizer with SDK.

This was made by the defunct company Mindmaker who created programs such as Prody Parrot and later versions of Creative Labs' TextAssist program.

Because this is abandonware, it does not have a license assigned to it.
