US economy shows unexpected strength
The US economy grew 0.2% in the last three months of 2001, official data has shown. 
The figure defied most economists' expectation that the world's largest economy would contract by up to 1%. 
Between July and September, the US economy had shrunk 1.3%. A second consecutive quarter of contraction would have satisfied the common technical definition of a recession. 
But looking at a variety of economic measures, an official panel of senior economists, the National Bureau of Economic Research, had declared last November that the US entered a recession in March 2001. 
Wall Street analysts attributed the unexpected strength of the economy's performance to higher government spending and consumers' enthusiastic take-up of zero percent financing deals offered by carmakers. 
However, the figures are just the "first cut" of the raw data. The last set of GDP figures was revised downwards several times, and the US economy still faces the threat to be technically in recession.
