<BLOCKQUOTE>This API is simple C interface that lets the user use almost all the 
features of FlexVoice. Altough this layer is not as flexible as the C++
API, in most of the applications it offers enough features to satisfy
the needs. There are two main advantage of this API, the simplicity and
the fact that it can be used also in C environment.

<P>When initializing the server (see <!1><A HREF="FVServerInitialize.html">FVServerInitialize</A>) the maximal
channel number should be set. It means that the server can serve as many
channels simultaneously. Trying to use more channels the requests will
return with 'busy' error. The speak requests can be passed to the server 
with the <!1><A HREF="FVServerSpeak.html">FVServerSpeak</A> method. During the processing the generated
data will be passed to the application by calling the 
<!1><A HREF="FVServerCallback.html">(*FVServerCallback)</A> C style callback function. The application can
transfer the got data to e.g. the sound card or to a file.
