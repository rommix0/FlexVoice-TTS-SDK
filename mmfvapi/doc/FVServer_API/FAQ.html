<DT><B>Q:</B><DD>   I'd like to set voices and dictionaries but I can't see any
support for it in the interface! Can I do it anyhow?
<DT><B>A:</B><DD>   Of course you can. The interface was planned to be as simple 
as it possible. It means that the complicated methods that 
can be found in the C++ API was removed but these features
are also available using embedded commands. 
(see Embedded Commands)
