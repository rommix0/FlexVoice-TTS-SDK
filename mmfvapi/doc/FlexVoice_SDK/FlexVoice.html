<BLOCKQUOTE>The main function of any TTS system is to process electronic text and
provide audio output. The special properties that distinguish FlexVoice
from existing products are:
<UL>
<LI> quality (intelligibility and naturalness) of speech;
<LI> flexibility to provide different voices, intonation, and output
formats;
<LI> small footprint, i.e. small distribution size;
<LI> low computational resources (CPU load and RAM).
</UL>
Based on a unique hybrid approach, FlexVoice maximizes the
advantages of the best traditional TTS implementations to offer
impeccable sounding, flexible, synthesized speech that is highly
intelligible yet requires remarkably low resources. Thus, FlexVoice
offers an efficient and effective solution for all of today's spoken
language delivery needs.

<P>In client-based applications, FlexVoice can bring life to personal
assistants, assistive tools, games, language learning programs, text
readers, and translation tools. On the server side, FlexVoice is the
perfect solution for call center automation, unified messaging,
information services, operator services, and mobile communications
services and devices.</BLOCKQUOTE>
