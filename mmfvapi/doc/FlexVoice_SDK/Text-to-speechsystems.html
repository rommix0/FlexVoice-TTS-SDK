<BLOCKQUOTE>With the increased importance of mobile computing and telephone            access to Web-based services, high quality, natural sounding speech
synthesis is crucial. Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis provides a means
of automatically converting written information into speech. It has the
same role as a person reading aloud. TTS is particularly useful for
reading text that has a high degree of variability, such as stock prices,
current events, or E-mail messages. For this type of text, solutions like
full pre-recorded messages or even the concatenation of pre-recorded
words are impractical or unsatisfactory. TTS offers a powerful and
efficent way of transmitting information via spoken language.
The FlexVoice SDK is a text-to-speech SDK that allows you to create
applications or products that use state-of-the-art speech synthesis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
