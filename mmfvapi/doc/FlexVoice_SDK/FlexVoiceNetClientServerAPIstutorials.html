by one or more FVNetClientTests return them to there originating client after converting
them to wave format.

<P>The FVNetClientTest Creates a client that should connect to the server. The return
value is a handle that should be used to reach the client's functionality. The zero
value means that the creation failed.

<P>Note that a functioning and accessable server is required in order for the
FVNetClient to function.

<P>FVnetClientTest.exe is a consoled based application, that converts text
into speech through a server and saves it into a given type and format wave file.
