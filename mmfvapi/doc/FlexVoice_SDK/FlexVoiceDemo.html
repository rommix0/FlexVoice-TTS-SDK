<BLOCKQUOTE>Simple GUI for the FlexVoice engine and dictionary editor.
FlexVoice Demo is a simple application designed to demonstrate all the major capabilities of the FlexVoice engine and its interfaces. From the General Tab Page you can select existing voices or create new ones, add effects to the selected voice, test your selected voice, save the output to a wave file and choose a format for the output file.
Speaker Use the Speaker section of the General Tab Page to create new voices, rename existing user defined voices, remove voices from the Speaker list, restore original characteristics to a base voice or import previously defined voices into the Speaker list.

<P>Test You can listen to a selected voice read either one of the default sample texts or you can insert one of your own.

<P>Effects You can vary the way the voice sounds, much the same as you can change the output of a compact disc player, these effects are not saved and will revert to the default settings each time you start the program.

<P>Output format Wave files can be generated in a number of formats depending on their usage, for example wave files for use in telephony are usually 8,000 KHz 8 bit whilst an audio book may require 22,000 kHz 16 bit for higher quality. Save The spoken text can be saved to a wave file of your choice, the default is Untitled.wav.

<P>Additional Features:

<P>Include embedded (read more at <A HREF=..\other\Embedded_commands\index.html>Embedded Commands</A> commands in your text to improve the reading performance and add character, or use musical note codes to create a song.

<P>On Windows platforms, the directory <TT>\Program&nbsp;Files\Mindmaker\FlexVoice3&nbsp;SDK\MMFVAPI\bin</TT> contains the binary.
