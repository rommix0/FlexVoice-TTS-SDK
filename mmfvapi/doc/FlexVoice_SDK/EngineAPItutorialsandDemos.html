This example shows how to instantiate a FlexVoice 3.0 engine and let it speak
to a file. Demonstrates the minimal set of calls to use FlexVoice 3.0 in
an application.

<P>On Windows platform the application is in <TT>&lt;instalation&nbsp;path&gt;\FlexVoice3&nbsp;SDK\bin\HelloWorld0.exe&nbsp;</TT>

<P>
<B>HelloWorld1 </B>

<P>This example is an extention of the previous one in as much as it finds the data directory on your
system and also it loads the speaker definitions included in the <TT>voicelist.tvl&nbsp;</TT>
file that acts as a registry of the available voices. This way, the user can
change speakers using embedded commands without blocking the output of the speech.

<P>On Windows platform the application is in <TT>&lt;instalation&nbsp;path&gt;\FlexVoice3&nbsp;SDK\bin\HelloWorld1.exe&nbsp;</TT>

<P>
<B>HelloWorld2 </B>

<P>In this example, a class is set up that is doing most of the work. Compared to the
previous example the functionality is not extended.

<P>On Windows platform the application is in <TT>&lt;instalation&nbsp;path&gt;\FlexVoice3&nbsp;SDK\bin\HelloWorld2.exe&nbsp;</TT>

<P>
<B>Say </B>

<P>This is a useful application that can be used to produce wave files using the text
to speech engine. Compared to the previous HelloWorld applications it adds command
line handling. <BR>
On Windows platforms, the directory <TT>\Program&nbsp;Files\Mindmaker\FlexVoice3&nbsp;SDK\bin\Say.exe.&nbsp;</TT>
