FlexVoice comes with some default speakers (Julie, Leslie, Tom, Ben)
that are represented by the speaker description files (.tav files)
These files can be found under the Voices directory in the
FlexVoice's data directory (see FlexVoice 3.0 engine)
Thes files refering to some other resources that are needed
for synthesizing the speech with the given speaker.
These resources are varying speaker by speaker. To obtain the
files that is required for the given speaker use the SpeakerFiles.exe
tool (part of the package). The additional resource files can be found
in the FlexVoice's data directory.</BLOCKQUOTE>
