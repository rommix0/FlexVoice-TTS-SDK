FlexVoice is implemented in a separate dll named FlexVoice_3_01_000.dll.
All the algorithms that are needed for the speech synthesis can be found here.
All interfaces and FlexVoice based applications use this dll.
The <TT>FlexVoice_3_01_000.dll</TT> can be found in the Window's system directory.

<P>The engine itself is requires some data files in order to function. These files
could be found at the Redistribution of FlexVoice section.

<P>In case of redistribution this location can be changed by the redistributor application.
The string-type registry entry: <TT>HKLM/Software/Mindmaker/CommonDirectory</TT> must
contain the current location.

<P>The ending of dll's and the data-directory's name (3_01_000) shows the binary
compatibility number. While the engine is binary compatible with the previous version
of it, this number doesn't change and in case of an upgrade this dll and the
datas are simply changed. If the engine looses the compatibility, it gets a new number
and the upgrade leaves the previous dll and datas in place and puts the new one
close to the previous ones. This solution lets the older, not refreshed applications use
the old dll while the new ones can use the new dll.
