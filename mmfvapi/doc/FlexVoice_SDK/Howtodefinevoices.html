<P>
Voice definitions are to be found in <TT>.tav</TT>, or voice definition files.
The voice definition files that come with FlexVoice can be found in
the <TT>Voices</TT> subdirectory of the FlexVoice data directory.
The <TT>voicelist.tvl</TT> file is normally used by programs to enumerate the
voices available on the system, so the <TT>voicelist.tvl</TT> file acts as
a registry. However, using the C++ API you can add individual voices
to the engine by just loading the voice definition directly from a <TT>.tav</TT>
file. Or you can even instatiate a Speaker object and fill in
the various parameters.
