<BLOCKQUOTE><B>What defines a voice?</B>

<P>At a high level, a voice is defined by its timbre and the associated intonation model. 
Both the timbre and the intonation model have many smaller components. In order to understand 
these components we need to learn a bit about the human sound production system. 
Phonemes are produced in different manners. Harmonic sounds are produced using the 
vocal folds. The sound coming out from the vocal folds is called the voicing source. 
This sound undergoes various changes as it travels in the vocal tract. These changes are 
determined by the positions of the various articulators in the vocal tract, basically the 
mouth, teeth, tongue positions, and the jaw opening, just to name a few. The resulting 
sound can be turbulent noise (like in an 's') or harmonic (like in the vowels), or mixed 
(like in 'z'). According to the dynamic characteristic, the sound can be sustained or fast 
changing (in plosives like 't' and 'b', when after a certain amount of silence the sound is 
suddenly 'released'). 

<P>The timbre of a voice is basically determined the static physical characteristics of the human 
sound production system, i.e., the size of the vocal tract and the sizes of the 
various articulators, the strength of the musculars of the vocal folds, etc. 

<P>Articulation is determined by how the state of the various articulators change as a 
function of time, i.e., articulation is related to the timing of changes in the state 
of the sound production system. More precisely, it is related to the timing on a fast 
time scale (0.1 seconds). 

<P>Finally, intonation is determined by rythm, pitch and volume (pitch is the frequency at 
which the vocal folds vibrate during sound production) as a function of time. Intonation 
works on a coarser time-scale than articulation (0.2+ seconds). 

<P>Timbre, articulation and intonation has different sligthly different roles in speech production. 
Timbre is associated with speaker properties. Men have larger mouth and lower average pitch 
than women. Someone can articulate more or even less precisely. Also, someone can speak 
faster, hesitate more, speak in a reading style, etc. Also, people can express emotions using 
intonation. However, both intonation and timbre contribute to the "nice" characteristics of a 
voice (a person with good physical capabilities can speak angrily or just in a careless 
way and then the person's voice will not be referred to as "nice" to listen to). 

<P>The timbre is defined by the characteristics of the voicing source and the vocal tract. 
In FlexVoice 3.0 the voicing source has a harmonic+noise model, i.e., it is modelled 
as the sum of a (parametric) harmonic part and a colored noise. Also, as the vocal fold vibrate 
one can differentiate between an open and a closed part of a period. The ratio of the 
open part compared to a full period is called the open quotient (it's natural range is [0,1]). 
A larger open quotient results in less supharmonics whilst a smaller open quotient results 
in a richer system of supharmonics. Also, one can set the decay of the supharmonics using a 
parameter called tilt (this sets the spectral tilt of the voicing source). 

<P>The basic parameter of the vocal tract determines its length - this corresponds to the 
size of the head.
