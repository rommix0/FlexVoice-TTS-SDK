<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of email normalization is to transform emails into a form that can
be read out in a natural and intelligible way by the FlexVoice text-to-speech system.
Only plain-text emails are handled, i.e., HTML is not.

<P><B>* Important note *</B>
ENorm is just a demo application. It is based on various heuristics that work for
most emails, but sometimes they make mistakes. (For example, unusually composed
separator lines are not recognized, only the most frequent smileys are detected,
signatures are not always recognized, etc.)
