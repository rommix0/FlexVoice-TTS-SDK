<BLOCKQUOTE>The FlexVoice Net Client/Server API is a simple interface to create 
a FlexVoice speech server and client applications that communicates 
with ICP/IP protocol.

<P>The server side uses a FlexVoice engine and listens in the given port.
When a request comes from the client it communicates the details, takes 
the input text and starts to create the speech. The generated data 
(in the required format) will be passed through the network and the 
client takes the action with the given data. If there's a problem
with the communication between the server and the client the 
connection will be aborted and the server will continue the listening.
There can be more client communicating with the server in the same time.
The number of the enabled simultanous clients can be set in the 
server side. It depends on the strength of the machine that runs the 
server (it sould be measured).

<P>A server should be created (see <!1><A HREF="FVNetServerCreate.html">FVNetServerCreate</A>) 
and initialized (see <!1><A HREF="FVNetServerInitialize.html">FVNetServerInitialize</A>) and it will start the 
listening and communicating with the clients automatically. At the end
of the session the server can be destroyed (see <!1><A HREF="FVNetServerDestroy.html">FVNetServerDestroy</A>).
Running the server it requires the installation of a full FlexVoice.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Server</B></FONT>

<P>The client doesn't require FlexVoice on the machine, it only takes 
the connection with the server and gets the data from it. 
After creating a client (see <!1><A HREF="FVNetClientCreate.html">FVNetClientCreate</A>) it should be 
connected to the server (see <!1><A HREF="FVNetClientConnect.html">FVNetClientConnect</A>). in case of
successful connection the requests can be sent to the server by 
calling the <!1><A HREF="FVNetClientSpeak.html">FVNetClientSpeak</A> method.
The results will come though a C-style callback function 
(see <!1><A HREF="FVNetClientCallback.html">(*FVNetClientCallback)</A>). The client can process 
the got data e.g it can pass it to the sound card or it can save the
result in a file. There's also possibility to wait for the end
of the speech by caling the <!1><A HREF="FVNetClientWait.html">FVNetClientWait</A> function.
When the client is not needed anymore it can be destroyed by the 
<!1><A HREF="FVNetClientDestroy.html">FVNetClientDestroy</A> call.
