<BLOCKQUOTE>In this example, a class is set up that is doing most of the work. Compared to the previous example the functionality is not extended. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="DOC.DOCU"></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In this example we use two classes: SpeechParams and WavFileWriter.

<P>SpeechParams sp;
sp.speaker = "JulieCalm";
sp.samplingFreq = 16000;

<P>With the SpeechParams class we can set the speaking voice("speaker") and 
various speech parameters("samplingFreq", 'speechRate", "pitch", "pitchRate"). 
The default value for all of the speech parameters is 0 (zero). In this sample 
we set the speaking voice to JulieCalm and the sampling frequency to 16000.

<P>
The WavFileWriter class is responsible for all operations required to 
generate speech and save it to a wave file. For details of what operations are needed 
for speech-generation see the <!1><A HREF="HelloWorld1.html">HelloWorld1</A> example. 

<P>WavFileWriter wfw( "Hello World", "hello.wav", sp )

<P>This class constructor requires 3 parameters: the text that will be converted to speech, the 
output file name and a SpeechParams instance. In our case we save the "Hello world" text into 
hello.wav file.

<P>if (wfw.writeFile()) return 0;
return -1;

<P>At the end of the sample we have a verification that the save to file succeded.
