<BLOCKQUOTE>The speaker is a set of parameters that descibe the voice and the prosody.
The speakers are stored in files (.tav) and can be edited by the VoiceEditor.
The structure is represented by the <!1><A HREF="Speaker.html">Speaker</A> class. It has a load
and the save methods that loads/saves the information stored in the
structure. Note that the load method doesn't also load the resources 
described in the structure. E.g. the voice description file that is 
referenced in the speaker structure (e.g. Julie.bin) is not loaded wehen 
loading the .tav file into the speaker, only it's name is stored. 
It will happen only after calling the factory's addSpeaker method. That's
why it is very important to add the loaded speakers to the factory, without
it the engine cannot use the not loaded resources.

<P>The parameters in the Speaker class can be referenced by their name.
The detailed parameter-description can be found in the description of the 
class (see <!1><A HREF="Speaker.html">Speaker</A> ).</BLOCKQUOTE>
