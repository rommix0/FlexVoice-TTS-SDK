<BLOCKQUOTE>By the notifications and in case of the expected phoneme output the engine
give phoneme codes to the application. The code is a simple integer that
depends on the used phoneme table. By default these codes are representing
the FlexVoice's inner phoneme table that doesn't contain too much 
information for the application. Unfortunately the used phoneme tables 
can be very different. Not only the codes are variing table by table but
even the phoneme sets. FlexVoice has to give useful phoneme information
to the applications not depending on the phoneme table they're using.
Of course it is not possible to burn all the used phoneme tables to 
FlexVoice and identify them by e.g. an id. To solve this problem we've 
chosen a general solution. 

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>IPA feature vectors</B></FONT>

<P>All phonemes can be described by features that was defined by IPA 
(International Phonetic Associations). This is a standard way 
(created by internationa linguists) to describe a phoneme by its 
features. Having these features it's clear which is the phoneme 
it's about not depending on even the language. This IPA description
doesn't deal with the diphones triphones and so on. We treat diphones
and triphones as a list of IPA features. 

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Phoneme Coders</B></FONT>

<P>If we have a phoneme table we can describe all its phoneme by a list
of the IPA features. It means that if the application uses a specific 
phoneme table and if it can provide a method that can convert its code
to a list of IPA features then FlexVoice can understand their codes.
And also if FlexVocie has a method that can convert its own phoneme codes
to IPA featire list the Application can understand these codes.

<P>This model is realized by the <!1><A HREF="IPhonemeCoder.html">IPhonemeCoder</A> interface. It has a 
method that can accept phoneme-table-specific phoneme codes and can
give IPA feature list. The coder also has to accept IPA features and should
give back the proper phoneme-table-specific phoneme code.

<P>If the application gives a phoneme coder to the engine, it can put its 
own phoneme codes to the inner phoneme coder that give IPA features which
can be put to the given coder that will be converted to application-specific
phoneme codes.
