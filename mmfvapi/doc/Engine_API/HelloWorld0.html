<BLOCKQUOTE>This example shows how to instantiate a FlexVoice 3.0 engine and let it speak to a file.  Demonstrates the minimal set of calls to use  FlexVoice 3.0 in an application.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="DOC.DOCU"></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After setting up various directory paths which we do not detail here, 
first, a TTS engine factory is created using the line<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
<TT>MM_TTSAPI::EngineFactory&nbsp;factory(&nbsp;NULL&nbsp;);</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
The factory can be used to create engine instances in a <EM>cheap</EM> (fast)
way. The only parameter of the factory is the path to the FlexVoice
data files. Please refer to the Release Notes to find out where
the data files are installed on your system. 

<P>Once the factory has been created you can create engines with it.
an engine is capable of speaking text using any voice and
an output site. The output site is an object that 
receives the output of the engine.
You must provide an output site at construction time so
we must create an output site first:<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
<TT>MM_TTSAPI::WaveOutputFormat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputFormat(&nbsp;16000,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;0&nbsp;);</TT><BR>
<TT>MM_TTSAPI::WaveFileOutputSite&nbsp;&nbsp;output(&nbsp;outputFormat&nbsp;);</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
The first of the above lines creates an output formatter object of
type <!1><A HREF="WaveOutputFormat.html">WaveOutputFormat</A> with a sampling frequency of 16000 kHz,
16 bits per sample and zero level 0.

<P>Next, an output site is created with the given output formatter object.
The output site created here is one that writes the output to a file
(<!1><A HREF="WaveFileOutputSite.html">WaveFileOutputSite</A>).

<P>Since the instantiation of the engine also requires a speaker or voice
to be defined we instantiate a speaker:<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>   
<TT>MM_TTSAPI::Speaker&nbsp;defSpeaker;</TT><BR>
<TT>defSpeaker.load(&nbsp;speakerFile.c_str()&nbsp;);</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
The second line loads the parameters of the speaker from an associated
speaker definition file (a "tav" file), which in our case is 
<TT>default.tav</TT> residing in the data directory of FlexVoice.

<P>Now, we need to add this speaker to the factory so that when we instantiate
the engine the factory will already know of this speaker and instantiation
of the engine will be faster (as it will not incur the cost of loading
the voice definition):<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
<TT>factory.addSpeaker(&nbsp;defSpeaker,&nbsp;MM_TTSAPI::SCS_LOAD_IMMEDIATELY_DO_NOT_DELETE&nbsp;);</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>

<P>Finally, we are ready to instantiate an engine:<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
<TT>{</TT><BR>
<TT>std::auto_ptr&lt;MM_TTSAPI::Engine&gt;&nbsp;engine</TT><BR> 
<TT>&nbsp;=&nbsp;factory.createEngine(&nbsp;&amp;output,&nbsp;defSpeaker,&nbsp;MM_TTSAPI::LNG_ENGLISH&nbsp;);</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
A number of things are to be noted here.
We pass to the engine the <EM>address</EM> of the output site. According
to the Programming Conventions of the FlexVoice API, if an object
is passed by its address then the ownership of the object is retained
by the caller. As a consequence, it is the responsibility of the
caller to "keep alive" the passed object during the lifetime of the
receiver (in this case the engine). 
If an object is passed by reference then a copy is made of the
object and no ownership issues arise.

<P>The last parameter determines the language. Currently, only US English
is supported. 

<P>The factory returns an engine pointer which is stored in an auto-pointer
(so that e.g. if an exception is thrown by some subsequent line the engine
is destructed appropriately).

<P>More about the opening brace (<TT>{</TT>) later.

<P>The next line opens a wave-file for writing:<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
<TT>output.open(&nbsp;&quot;hello.wav&quot;,&nbsp;outputFormat&nbsp;);</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
Here the first parameter is the name of the file, the second
determines the required format (this format overwrites the format
given previously).

<P>Finally, we let the engine speak:<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>    
<TT>engine-&gt;speakRequest(&nbsp;&quot;Hello&nbsp;World!&quot;,&nbsp;1&nbsp;);</TT><BR>
<TT>engine-&gt;wait();</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
In the first line a speak request is sent to the TTS engine with
the text "Hello World". The engine is asked to repeat the output
once (second parameter). This call to the engine is asynchronous:
the call returns immediately after the request is accepted by
the engine, i.e., before the actual speech has been generated.
Since the engine cannot be shut down and the output cannot be closed
before the engine has stopped speaking, one must wait until that
time. This is the purpose of the second line. This line blocks the
execution of the client thread until the engine has fully processed all
of its inputs and sent the resulting speech to the output site.

<P>Once this call returns it is safe to close the output site and shut down
the engine:<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
<TT>output.close();</TT><BR>
<TT>}</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
Note that upon arriving at the closing brace (<TT>}</TT>) <TT>auto_ptr</TT> destructs
its pointee, i.e., the engine. The first line simply closes the output site
and as a result the file associated with it.

<P>Finally, we may return from the code, destructing the factory:<BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
<TT>return&nbsp;0;</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
Note that the factory <EM>should not</EM> be destructed until there is a living
engine that was created through the factory. This is because the
factory manages resources shared among the engines. In this example
this is achieved by introducing the scope using the opening and closing
braces and having the engine destructed by leaving the scope.

<P>This concludes this tutorial.
