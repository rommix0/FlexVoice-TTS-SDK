<DT><B>Q:</B><DD>   I am experiencing problems with getting your sample codes to 
run after I compile them. I am also having a problem with
compiling my code. I have Win32.
<DT><B>A:</B><DD>   Don't forget to set the STL-patch include directory in
Developer Studio (<TT>Tools\Options\Directories\Include&nbsp;files</TT>).
The <EM>very</EM> first directory should be the STL patch
directory since the STL that comes with VC 6.0 SP4 is buggy
and FlexVoice was compiled with the patched STL whose
files are listed in the given STL patch directory.
The STL patch directory is normally 
<TT>\Program&nbsp;Files\Mindmaker\FlexVoice&nbsp;3.0\SDK\include\STL-patch</TT>.
<DT><B>Q:</B><DD>   On Win32, I've put together a program that uses FlexVoice,
I did everything as required (as per your HelloWorld sample codes)
but the engine still crashes when I try to create it. What
am I doing wrong?
<DT><B>A:</B><DD>   There are two possible causes. The first is that the data directory
you specified does not have all the necessary data. If the 
sample codes (most notably the <TT>say</TT> application) functions
correctly then look for a directory where "voicelist.tvl" resides
- this is the correct data directory. If <TT>say</TT> fails, you have 
probably broken the data directory - it is best if you reinstall
your system. The second reason is that some compiler settings
may not be set, most notably RTTI and exception support must be
set. See also the previous FAQ item.
