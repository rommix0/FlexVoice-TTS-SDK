<BLOCKQUOTE>The factory has two main functionality. The first is to create 
the engines and the second is to store the resources required by the
engines and the speakers. Besides these tasks the factory also stores 
the dictionaries.
The factory should be initialized by passing a path to it to define
where the factory can find the files that is required for the 
initialization. The application should decide which speakers it wants 
to use and should pass them to the factory. With this the factory loads 
the resources that is required by the speakers. 
This initialization may take a few seconds and it shows
one of the main advantage of the factory, while after this initialization
the engine creation doesn't require further file-reading that reduces the
initialization time of the engines.</BLOCKQUOTE>
