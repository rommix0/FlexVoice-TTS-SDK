<BLOCKQUOTE>During the speech there are many events that can be important for the
user. These events can be the speech start/stop events, the notifications 
about the currently speaking specific parts of the text such as the 
beginning and the ends of the sentences, words and even the phonemes.
The notifications are passed to the OutputSites that dispatches them 
to the listeners. To handle the notifications the user should implement
the <!1><A HREF="INotify.html">INotify</A> interface and should register it to the OutputSite
(see <!1><A HREF="WavePlayOutputSiteEx.html#DOC.1.3.12.1.1.8">registerNotify</A>). Note that only those notifications will be 
passed to the listener that are explicit listed by the registration.
Before destroying the listener object it should be unregistered from
the OutputSite! 
The <!1><A HREF="Bookmark.html">Bookmark</A> is passed to listener object by calling its 
<!1><A HREF="NotifyTransfer.html#DOC.1.3.5.4.3">bookmark</A> method. Depending on the implementation of the OutputSite
it calls the <!1><A HREF="NotifyTransfer.html#DOC.1.3.5.4.4">prepare</A> method of the listener to give time it to 
prepare for the real event.

<P>Depending on the type of the <!1><A HREF="Bookmark.html">Bookmark</A> some of them can be 
dynamic_cast-ed to its real type that can contain specific information
about the specific event.

<P>The base <!1><A HREF="Bookmark.html">Bookmark</A> contains information about the event, about
its text positioning and about its timing.

<P>It is very important to ensure that the notification method should return
as soon as possible while taking much time in the bookmark() and the prepare()
methods can cause problems in the engine. Also important that in these methods
no synchron methods should be called from the engine while it can cause 
deadlocks. E.g. if the engine's wait() method is called in the bookmark 
it will cause explicit deadlock, while the engine's wait() call doesn't 
return until the speech is finished but it cannot because the notification 
didn't return yet. To avoid these problems the <!1><A HREF="NotifyTransfer.html">NotifyTransfer</A> object
can be used that transfers the notifications to another thread that 
ensures that the the notification can't block the engine.</BLOCKQUOTE>
