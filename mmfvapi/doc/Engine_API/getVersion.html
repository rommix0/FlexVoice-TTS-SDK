<BLOCKQUOTE>Returns version information of the engine loaded into memory.
Use this function to check if the build version of the headers that
you are using (in your project) is the same as the version of the engine.
It might be that these versions are different but your code still compiles.
Note that the version information changes only when you need to recompile
your code in order to get your code to work correctly with the new "version".
There are changes (e.g. bugfixes) that do not require recompilation
of your code. For such changes the version information will not be
changed. If the version information is changed the name of the main <TT>dll</TT>
file (<TT>so</TT> file on Linux; on other operating systems the extension may
be something else) will be changed at the same time, so your old code will not be 
broken when someone installs an upgraded package of FlexVoice on the system.
However, this also means that your old code will not take advantage of
the new features of the updated FlexVoice package. Upon version 
number changes, the changes will be highlighted in the Release Notes.
It is our intention and best interest to minimize the frequency
of version number changes.

<P>Since your code may compile even with old include files and a newer
dll, it is a good practice and is <EM>very strongly recommended</EM>
that you check the
version information at start-up, e.g. by adding the line
<TT></TT><BR>
<TT>assert(&nbsp;strcmp(&nbsp;MM_TTSAPI::getVersion(),&nbsp;FLEX_VOICE_VERSION&nbsp;)&nbsp;==&nbsp;0&nbsp;)</TT><BR>
<TT></TT><BR>
to the beginning of your program.
These lines assume that you have included <TT>cassert</TT> and this file (<TT>Version.h</TT>)
at the beginning of your file.</BLOCKQUOTE>
