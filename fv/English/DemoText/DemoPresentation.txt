\Vce=Speaker="Julie"\\rspd=100\
Welcome to the demonstration of FlexVoice. We're 
going to hear how the embedded commands enhance 
the speech.
 
First, the speaker changes. Let's change to the 
speaker called Ben.
 
\Vce=Speaker="Ben"\
Hi Julie! How are you today? 
 
\Vce=Speaker="Julie"\
Fine thanks! Let's continue with Leslie and Tom!
 
\Vce=Speaker="Leslie"\
Hi, my name is Leslie.
 
\Vce=Speaker="Tom"\
Tom's speaking!
 
\Vce=Speaker="Julie"\
Thanks guys.
 
\rspd=100\ 
By altering \rspd=60\ speed or \vol=220\ volume, 
\vol=100\ \rspd=100\  you can easily draw attention to 
a specific portion of the text. Long lists are also more 
comprehensible this way.
 
Finally let's listen to how the word \rspd=80\ "Mind"  
\rspd=100\ is spelled. For better articulation pause is 
also used. The spelling is: \pau=1000\ \wspell\ 
\rspd=80\ "Mind".
 
This concludes our demonstration.
