FlexVoice Text-To-Speech, developed by Mindmaker is a 
state-of the art speech synthesis technology. 
FlexVoice is based on a unique hybrid approach that maximizes 
the advantages of the best traditional TTS implementations. 

As a result the output of FlexVoice is both natural-sounding and flexible.

In addition to this, the amount of run-time memory needed by the system is so small 
that many parallel instances of FlexVoice can be run simultaneously, each speaking on the 
voice of a different individual.

FlexVoice is built using Mindmaker's advanced machine-learning technologies,
substantially reducing the development time for new languages and voices.

Mindmaker also offers other speech technologies, such as a plug-in 
speech recognition system, called Tisento. Tisento allows the easy development of various 
telephony applications.

For more information about Tisento or other Mindmaker products, please contact our 
colleagues at Mindmaker, or visit our web-site at www.mindmaker.com.

Thank you for your attention.
